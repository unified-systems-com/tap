"""Credential-shape detection for source control — `req-tap-cares-secrets-credential-patterns`.

The sibling of the envelope scanner in :mod:`tap.runtime_secrets`. That one is
*structural*: it knows TAP's secret envelope and catches a `*.secret.json` committed
with `git add -f`, or a real secret renamed to dodge the suffix. It is excellent at
what it covers and blind to everything else — it reads only `*.json`, so a token
pasted into a `.py`, `.md`, `.sh`, `.yml` or `.env`, or a private key in a `.pem`, is
invisible to it.

This module closes that gap for the credential shapes that can be recognized with
near-zero false positives, and is deliberately narrow about which those are.

**Why issuer-prefixed shapes and not entropy.** A full-history `gitleaks` run over
this repository (1,198 commits, 2026-07-22) produced 13 findings, all from its
entropy-based `generic-api-key` rule and all false positives: log-site-id constants,
an AWS `OriginAccessControlId` in a test fixture, `s3cret-pw-xyz` in a superuser test,
and `authz denied:` lines in committed log samples. Entropy cannot separate "high
Shannon score" from "credential" in a codebase whose test fixtures are full of opaque
identifiers. The patterns below key on the *issuer's own prefix and length* instead,
which is self-identifying: `github_pat_`, `AKIA`, a PEM armor header. The same run
found zero matches for these across 874 text files, which is what makes the guard a
hard zero rather than a ratcheting baseline — there is no accepted-debt list, because
an accepted list of leaked credentials is not a thing that should exist.

**What this deliberately does NOT catch** (honest-risk, `req-sec-honest-risk`):
AWS *secret* access keys, database passwords, bare high-entropy strings, and any
credential with no distinguishing prefix. Those are entropy problems, and entropy
belongs in the per-push `gitleaks` CI step where a human triages findings — not in a
hard-zero guard that must never cry wolf. This module is the fast, exact layer; it is
not, and does not claim to be, a general-purpose secret scanner.

Import-safe and settings-free by design: the pre-commit hook
(`.githooks/pre-commit`) imports it directly with no Django configured, and so does
the guard that walks the whole tree.
